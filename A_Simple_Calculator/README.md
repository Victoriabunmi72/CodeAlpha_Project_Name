# VOO_Calc

This project is a simple calculator, branded as **VOO_Calc**, created as part of my **Code Alpha Internship**. It demonstrates fundamental arithmetic operations alongside additional advanced functionalities, showcasing my growth in frontend development.

## Internship Details
- **Internship Program**: Code Alpha
- **Internship Duration**: 1 month
- **Chosen Track**: Frontend Development
- **Task**: Calculator Project (Task 2)
- **Start Date**: December 21, 2024

## Task 2: Build a Calculator
**Description**:
Create a calculator with basic arithmetic operation functionalities like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Design a user-friendly interface with buttons for data entry and a display screen for showing results. This task enhances essential knowledge in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Features
1. **Basic Arithmetic**:
   - Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

2. **Advanced Functionalities**:
   - Percentage calculation.
   - Square root computation.
   - Exponentiation (e.g., powers and squares).
   - Trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent).
   - Logarithmic calculations (natural and base-10).

3. **Branded Interface**:
   - Calculator is branded as **VOO_Calc**, reflecting the initials of the creator's full name, "Victoria Oluwabunmi Olabode."

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensures usability across various screen sizes.
